## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R (≥ 4.0) installed with the following packages:

```r
required_packages <- c(
  "shiny", "shinydashboard", "shinyWidgets", "DT",
  "tidyverse", "tidymodels", "plotly", "ggthemes", 
  "glmnet", "randomForest", "xgboost", "Metrics",
  "furrr", "tune", "scales", "RColorBrewer", "viridis"
)

install.packages(required_packages)
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unicorn-dashboard.git
   cd unicorn-dashboard
   ```

2. **Prepare the dataset**
   
   Since the CSV dataset couldn't be uploaded to GitHub, you'll need to:
   
   - Place your `Final_Dataset_Modified.csv` in the project root

3. **Run the preprocessing script**
   ```r
   source("Final_model.R")
   ```
   This will:
   - Clean and preprocess the data
   - Train machine learning models
   - Generate `unicorn_data.RData`

4. **Launch the dashboard**
   ```r
   shiny::runApp("app.R")
   ```

## 🔧 Data Setup

### If you don't have the original dataset:

Create a sample dataset to test the application:

```r
# Generate sample unicorn data
set.seed(42)
sample_data <- data.frame(
  Company = paste0("Company_", 1:100),
  `Valuation ($B)` = runif(100, 1, 50),
  Country = sample(c("United States", "China", "India", "United Kingdom"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  Industry = sample(c("Fintech", "AI", "E-commerce", "Healthcare"), 100, replace = TRUE),
  `Founded Year` = sample(2010:2020, 100, replace = TRUE),
  `Total Raised` = runif(100, 0.1, 5),
  `Estimated Revenue` = runif(100, 0.05, 3),
  `Investors Count` = sample(5:50, 100, replace = TRUE),
  `Number of Employees` = sample(100:5000, 100, replace = TRUE),
  # ... add other required columns
)

write.csv(sample_data, "Final_Dataset_Modified.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
